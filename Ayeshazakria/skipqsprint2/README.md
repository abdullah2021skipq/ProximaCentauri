## project description:

In this project we are building CI/CD Pipeline using AWS Pipelines.<br>

-CI/CD
An integral part of DevOps is adopting the culture of continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment (CI/CD)<br>
where a commit or change to code passes through various automated stage gates, all the way from building and testing to deploying applications,<br>
from development to production environments.<br>
AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service you can use to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release your software.<br>
You can quickly model and configure the different stages of a software release process. CodePipeline automates the steps required to release<br>
your software changes continuously<br>

## services used:

- CodeBuild
- Cloudformation
- S3
- IAM

## Installation steps


```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install aws-cdk using npm

```
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

Bootstrap the project to provision resources from the aws cloud

```
cdk bootstrap
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
$ cdk deploy
```
